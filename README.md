## Backend
For the backend it uses a REST API made using NodeJS and MySQL. Here is the link to it's code [UniPal_Backend]

### Important
Due to privacy and resource abuse concerns I have kept the url of the backend API private and you won't be able to see it. Therefore, if you want to work with this project and make your own edits, than you also need to deploy the backend on your own and pass the **URL** to the flutter app. 
Don't be confused, you **CAN** use my backend code provided above, you just have to deploy it on a server of your own. There are plenty of free options including:
 - Heroku
 - AWS Free Tier
 - Azure etc.

For more instruction visit the backend [README](https://github.com/cyntaria/UniPal-Backend#dvd-installation).

Once deployed, pass the url while running the flutter app like this:

```dart
// Replace your-url-here with your own deployed URL like "https://example.com/api/v1"
flutter run --dart-define=BASE_URL="your-url-here"
```

## ‚≠ê Installing

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. These series of steps need to be followed for the app to run:

    1. Make sure you are on Flutter v3.0.0 and Dart SDK 2.18
    2. If not, run `flutter uprade`.
    3. Open project dir and run this command in root directory
        ```
        flutter pub get
        ```
    4. Since the project uses code generation, alot of the files are missing initially. To generate them run this in root dir
        ```
        flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs --enable-experiment=super-parameters
